                        <h5>What is Digital Brand Strategy?</h5>
                        <p>
                            A comprehensive plan that helps you communicate your
                            company's identity to consumers online to increase customer
                            loyalty and sales. A digital brand strategy also defines how
                            your organization wishes to be perceived by consumers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What makes it unique? What do you want people to think about
                            your product or service? By creating guidelines for your
                            brand, you can ensure every interaction with consumers
                            remains consistent.

                        <p>
                            Creating an effective digital brand takes time, effort, and

                            up with a few dozen hashtags, and calling. Let's dive into
                            the roadmap for building a digital brand strategy with a few
                            detailed examples.

                        <h5>Digital Branding vs. Digital Marketing</h5>
                        <p>
                            It is a common misconception to confuse digital marketing
                            and digital branding. While you may think that these phrases
                            are interchangeable, there is a distinct difference.
                            Creating an effective digital brand takes time, effort, and
                            due diligence. It's not as simple as making a logo, showing
                            up with a few dozen hashtags, and calling it a day.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Are You Ready to Digitize Your Business Brand?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Now it is clear what digital branding is and what are the
                            strategies. That means it’s time for you to put it into
                            practice. There are nine ways that you can use for maximum
                            the results.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, you can also try some of the strategies that you
                            think are the easiest and most important. For example, you
                            can start by creating a logo, using social media, or
                            creating a website. Keep the spirit and see you on the next
